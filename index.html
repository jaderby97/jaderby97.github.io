    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Jake Derby and I am an aspiring data professional with a background in psychology/mental health, healthcare and laboratory science.</p>

    <p>I have experience transforming messy data into a workable form to build dashboards and predictive models using Python, R, SQL and various data visualization tools.</p>

    <p>My site here highlights a handful of projects that I hope you find interesting. Thank you!</p>

    <h2>Work / Projects</h2>
    <ul class="project-list">
      <li>
        <h3>Predicting Loan Outcomes (LendingClub)</h3>
        <p>Built a simple ensemble (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost). Handled data leakage, automated hyperparameter tuning, and created clear visualizations—resulting in a solid, defensible model.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Forecasting U.S. Retail Sales Post-COVID</h3>
        <p>Implemented a SARIMA model with grid-searched hyperparameters; showcased datetime wrangling in pandas and visualization. Hold-out accuracy dipped right after COVID, highlighting real-world regime shifts in economic data.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Movie Recommendation System</h3>
        <p>Combined collaborative filtering with safeguards against data sparsity. Heavy preprocessing (merges, pivots) produced a robust, user-friendly pipeline that can scale to larger datasets.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>California Childcare Cost Analysis</h3>
        <p>Exploratory and time-series analysis of childcare costs across California. Extensive Python visualization and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to surface trends and regional differences.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jaderby97/ChildcareCostsInCalifornia">Repo</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>TSA Complaint Analysis</h3>
        <p>Analyzed changes in complaint type and volume across airports over time. Built time-series visuals and geographic heatmaps; visual patterns reflect procedural changes in TSA processes.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jaderby97/TSA_Complaints">Repo</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Predicting Negro League Players’ MLB Performance</h3>
        <p>Modeled performance using historical data for players who appeared in both leagues. Findings show most performed the same or better in MLB—supporting integration of NLB stats into official MLB records.</p>
        <!-- <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/nlb-mlb-performance">Repo</a> -->
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Detecting Fraudulent Job Postings</h3>
        <p>High-performing random forest (ROC-AUC 0.98) with NLP features: stop-word removal and TF-IDF vectorization. Strong precision/recall and overall accuracy.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jaderby97/FraudulentJobPostDetection">Repo</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy</h3>
        <p>Identified key financial indicators and compared logistic regression vs. XGBoost on bankruptcy prediction, focusing on interpretability vs. raw performance.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jaderby97/BankruptcyPrediction">Repo</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Measuring Linguistic Complexity in State of the Union Addresses</h3>
        <p>Web-scraped SOTU speeches (2000s) and used NLP metrics to compare complexity across presidents and over time.</p>
        <a href="https://github.com/jaderby97/SOTU_LinguisticComplexityAnalysis">Repo</a>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Designed &amp; Built a SQL Database</h3>
        <p>Converted business rules into an ERD, implemented a 3NF schema, and wrote sample queries demonstrating efficiency and business impact.</p>
